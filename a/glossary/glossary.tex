\newglossaryentry{isophote}
{
	name={isophote},
	description={a curve on an illuminated surface that connects points of equal brightness. In astronomy, the isophote is commonly used to define two things: the shape of an object, and the amount of light it gives off. The most common use of isophotes in astronomy is in the imaging and classification of galaxies, particularly of elliptical galaxies. The isophotes of elliptical galaxies provide information on a galaxy's shape, and hence upon its structure and dynamical behavior. Isophotes can be used on spiral galaxies, too, particularly to measure their radii, or to map the structures within their spiral arms. Isophotes are also used to measure the size, structure, and brightness of many gaseous or tenuous objects, such as X-ray galaxy clusters, radio jets from quasars, and the distribution of dust in our Galaxy. They have even been used to map the light reflected from the Moon and other planets to understand the properties of their surfaces}

\newglossaryentry{absolute magnitude}
{
	name={absolute magnitude},
	description={a measure of the luminosity of a celestial object, on a logarithmic astronomical magnitude scale. An object's absolute magnitude is defined to be equal to the apparent magnitude that the object would have if it were viewed from a distance of exactly 10 parsecs (32.6 light-years), with no extinction (or dimming) of its light due to absorption by interstellar dust particles. By hypothetically placing all objects at a standard reference distance from the observer, their luminosities can be directly compared on a magnitude scale}

\newglossaryentry{galaxy harassment}
{
	name={galaxy harassment},
	description={a type of interaction between a low-luminosity galaxy and a brighter one that takes place within rich galaxy clusters, such as Virgo and Coma, where galaxies are moving at high relative speeds and suffering frequent encounters with other systems of the cluster by the high galactic density of the latter. According to computer simulations, the interactions convert the affected galaxy disks into disturbed barred spiral galaxies and produces starbursts followed by, if more encounters occur, loss of angular momentum and heating of their gas. The result would be the conversion of (late type) low-luminosity spiral galaxies into dwarf spheroidals and dwarf ellipticals}
